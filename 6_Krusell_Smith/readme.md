1. Main.m : main file to run overall code. 

2. constructTrans.m : This file constructs 4 by 4 transition matrix using given information using Krusell-Smith's assumption.

3. shock_Simul.m : This code simulate the aggregate and idiosyncratic status using initial distribution, with 10,000 agents for 1000 periods

4. solveIND.m : This file solve the individual agent's problem using policy function iteration.

5. aggSimul.m : Using the optimal policy function, this file simulates cross-sectional distribution, and records first-moment and cross-sectional distribution every periods.
